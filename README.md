# PitchPrediction

For a Major League batter, one of the most challenging aspects of the game is recognizing the pitch type. As baseball becomes more technologically advanced, the need for analytics is now much more crucial. This study evaluates the relationship between the type of pitch about to be thrown and factors such as the location and velocity of the previous two pitches. Using three pitchers, Hyun-Jin Ryu, Gerrit Cole, and Michael Wacha, this study creates a logistic regression model to observe the relationship between these factors at an individual level. The results of this study provide insight into a pitcher’s most telling attributes, also allowing us to compare the significant trends between multiple pitchers. 

This paper was submitted to the USCLAP competition and results are pending.
